# Checks a commit against the tf- tag rules and prints the tag to push.
#
# Usage: just tf-check [<commit-ish>]   (default: HEAD)
#
# A rejected tag has to be deleted locally and remotely before retrying, and an
# unwanted build spends one of the day's App Store Connect uploads (the cap behind
# ITMS-90382). So the workflow's own checks run here first, and the exact tag with
# the next free BUILD number is printed only when nothing blocks it. An agent may
# push that tag after "Ready"; a `v` tag and App Review submission stay with the
# owner (docs/testflight.md).
#
# Read-only: it fetches but never tags or pushes. gh is optional — without it the
# tests state is reported as unknown, and unknown is not ready.

Ready. Round $next of $version:

  git tag -a -F <what-to-test.txt> $tag ${sha:0:12}
  git push $REMOTE $tag

The annotation is this round's What to Test: a checklist of observable pass/fail
behavior plus what was not verified. Paste it into App Store Connect when the
build appears.
