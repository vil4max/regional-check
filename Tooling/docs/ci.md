# CI pipeline — identical in every iOS app

One pipeline for every app on this Runtime (owner decision, 2026-09-21). The
workflow files are copied unchanged; what differs between apps is a repository
variable or the app's own `ci` recipe, never the workflow text. Why: three apps
had three pipelines (three jobs with Sonar, one job, none), so a fix found in one
never reached the others and nobody could tell which behavior was intended.

## Baseline

The apps must not drift apart (owner decision, 2026-09-21), so the shared part is
checked, not copied by hand:

- `pipeline: shared` in `Tooling/runtime.yml` makes every install and
  `just harness-update` rewrite `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, `testflight.yml`
  and `ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh` from the Runtime templates, and
  `Tooling/.swiftlint.yml` / `.swiftformat` from the style templates
  ([style-config.md](style-config.md)). A template
  change reaches every app with its next update; hand edits are overwritten.
- `just baseline` (and the start of `just verify`) fails when a managed file
  differs from its template, `simulator.name` is a machine-shared device,
  `simulator.device_type` / `simulator.os` are not `iPhone 17` / `27.0`, or
  `MARKETING_VERSION` is not one `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` in every configuration.
- It warns — and `just baseline --strict` fails — when the app has not opted in,
  its installed Runtime lags the Runtime checkout, or other workflows sit next to
  the shared ones. Before the opt-in, file drift is a warning too.

Why a gate and not a checklist: within one day three apps had three pipelines,
and a workflow copied by hand went stale the next time its template changed.

## Pieces

| Piece | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/tests.yml` | `Tooling/templates/github/tests.yml` | On push to `main` and on pull requests: `just ci` on a macOS runner; coverage summary; `build/ci` uploaded as `ci-output`; optional Sonar job |
| `.github/workflows/testflight.yml` | `Tooling/templates/github/testflight.yml` | On a `tf-` or `v` tag: [tag-gated TestFlight](testflight.md) |
| `ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh` (next to the `.xcodeproj`) | `Tooling/templates/ci_post_clone.sh` | In Xcode Cloud: build number from `CI_BUILD_NUMBER`; trust SwiftPM plugins and macros |
| Xcode Cloud workflow | App Store Connect, owner | One workflow, started by the `testflight` branch only, archives for internal TestFlight |

## `just ci`

Runtime `ci.sh` runs the same gate as `just verify` and writes the test result
bundle to `build/ci/results/tests.xcresult`. With `CI=true` (GitHub sets it on
hosted and self-hosted runners):

- `just format` checks with `swiftformat --lint` and fails instead of rewriting;
- xcodebuild signs ad hoc (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=-`, keeps Keychain access for
  tests); `ci.signing: none` in `Tooling/runtime.yml` disables signing instead;
- code coverage is on and parallel testing is off.

An app with more CI work overrides the recipe in its root justfile (which has
`set allow-duplicate-recipes` after `import 'Tooling/justfile'`) and calls the
Runtime first:

```just
ci:
    ./Tooling/scripts/build-slot.sh run ./Tooling/scripts/ci.sh
    ./scripts/ci-extra.sh   # another test plan, coverage conversion, …
```

Anything the Sonar job should read goes under `build/ci/`; it expects
`build/ci/sonar/coverage.xml` and an app-owned `sonar-project.properties`.

An agent session uses exactly one simulator of its own, for runs and tests:
`<host>-<App>-<session id, 8 chars>` (`claude-Pitstop-0a1b2c3d`; a linked
worktree adds `-<worktree>`), created on demand from the Claude desktop session
id (`CLAUDE_CODE_HOST_SESSION_ID`, listed with the sidebar title, so a device
maps to its session), `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` in the CLI, or
`AGENT_HOST`/`AGENT_SESSION_ID` for other hosts (owner rule, 2026-09-21:
sessions kept attaching to one another's devices and waiting on them). Without a
session — a person's shell, CI — an app has `<scheme> iPhone 17` for runs and
`<scheme> iPhone 17 Tests` for tests (`simulator.*` keys in [api.md](api.md));
`just sim-clean` removes the app's own leftover test clones. The coordinating
session prunes the Mac with `scripts/sim-fleet.py prune` (dry run; `--apply`
deletes): it keeps booted devices, session devices used in the last 3 days and
`--keep` names, and deletes every other shut-down device. Set `simulator.os` (for example `"27.0"`) when the
app needs a specific iOS; unset means the newest installed runtime.

Never launch the app by hand on the test device. An app with a Live Activity or
widgets is relaunched by the system after one manual launch, and a running
instance takes the test launch without XCTest: the run waits and fails with "The
test runner hung before establishing connection", which reads like load or a code
defect. The xcodebuild backend therefore stops a running instance before each
run, and on that hang erases the app's own test device and retries once (the
failure precedes every test, so the retry cannot hide a failing test). A reserved
`simulator.test_udid` is never erased; the run reports it instead.

## Repository variables

| Variable | Default | Set it when |
|---|---|---|
| `IOS_RUNNER` | `xcode-27` (GitHub-hosted) for a public repository, `self-hosted` for a private one | A runner needs another label. A private repository never defaults to hosted macOS, which GitHub Free bills at ten times the Linux rate; without a registered runner its job waits instead of spending minutes |
| `IOS_DEVELOPER_DIR` | `/Applications/Xcode_27.0.app/Contents/Developer` | The runner's Xcode lives elsewhere (self-hosted: `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`) |
| `SONAR_ENABLED` | unset | The app reports to SonarQube Cloud (needs secret `SONAR_TOKEN`) |

## Repository settings

Every iOS app repository is set up the same way (owner decision, 2026-09-21):

- **Name:** lowercase kebab-case ending in `-ios` (`pitstop-ios`, `onecart-ios`).
  An App Store Support or Privacy Policy URL that points into the repository
  changes with a rename; the Privacy Policy URL is app-level, the Support URL
  changes only with the next version.
- **Public, clean history.** A repository becomes public only after a clean
  full-history private-data scan (kit `features/policy/private-data-scan.py
  --history`). When the old history holds private data, move to a new repository
  with rewritten history instead of force-pushing: GitHub keeps every pull
  request's original commits, and only GitHub Support can remove them. The
  procedure and its Xcode Cloud checklist: [repository-move.md](repository-move.md).
  `AGENTS.md` declares `Repository visibility: **PUBLIC**.`, which turns on the
  pre-push private-data scan.
- **Rulesets:** create the three templates, active and without bypass actors:

  ```bash
  for r in delivery-branches release-tags testflight-tags; do
    gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/rulesets --input "Tooling/templates/github/rulesets/$r.json"
  done
  ```

  `main` and `testflight` cannot be deleted or rewritten; a `v` tag cannot be
  moved or deleted, since it records what was submitted. A `tf-` tag cannot be
  moved but can be deleted: a tag the workflow rejected is deleted and a fixed
  commit tagged with the next BUILD (`tf-check.sh`), and a deletion rule would
  leave no one able to do that (found by OneCart). There is no required status check and no pull-request rule: both
  would block the direct pushes to `main` that the tag model relies on, and
  `tf-check` already requires the tagged commit's own green run.
- **Xcode Cloud access:** the Xcode Cloud GitHub app is granted per repository,
  not per name. A new repository, even under an old name, is added under
  github.com/settings/installations → Xcode Cloud → Repository access before its
  workflow can build. The workflow also stays bound to the old repository's
  ID. Either of two ways re-binds it: Xcode Cloud → Settings → Repositories →
  Change URL on the old entry (pitstop), or New Primary Repository in the
  workflow editor, which adds the new repository as a separate entry
  (OneCart: `tf-1.3.0-1` then started build 112 on its own). Re-bind before
  the first `tf-` tag; a branch move before it starts nothing, and needs Start
  Build on `testflight` (pitstop's first round).

## Self-hosted runner on this Mac

A private app runs its tests here. The runner's jobs go through the same
machine-wide build slots as every local session (`just build-slot status`), so a
CI run cannot overload the Mac. Security: register it only to private
repositories — a public repository would let fork pull requests run code on it.
Before a repository goes public, uninstall the service and remove the runner
registration (after a rename `config.sh remove` can fail; delete it through the
API: `gh api -X DELETE repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runners/<id>`).

The owner performs the registration because it needs a token from GitHub:

1. GitHub → repository → Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner →
   macOS, ARM64. Run the shown download and `./config.sh --url … --token …`
   commands in `~/actions-runner/<repository>`; accept the default labels
   (`self-hosted`, `macOS`, `ARM64`).
2. Install it as a service so it survives logout: `./svc.sh install`, then
   `./svc.sh start`.
3. Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables:
   `IOS_DEVELOPER_DIR` = `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
   (`IOS_RUNNER` is not needed: a private repository already defaults to
   `self-hosted`).

CI then runs only while the Mac is on; a queued run starts when it wakes.

## Build slots

`just build`, `test`, `verify`, `ci` and `run-sim` each hold one of `BUILD_SLOTS`
(default 2) machine-wide slots in `~/Library/Caches/ios-agent-toolchain/build-slots`
for their whole run; `just build-slot acquire <label> [minutes]` holds one for
Xcode MCP work. The directory is outside every repository on purpose: slots kept
per repository let one app's tests push the load to about 800 on 10 cores and
fail another app's gate.

## First TestFlight for a new app (owner, App Store Connect)

An app without an App Store Connect record gets one once:

1. `MARKETING_VERSION` has three components (`1.0.0`, not `1.0`): tags are
   `tf-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD` and tf-check compares them literally.
2. developer.apple.com → Identifiers: register the app's bundle ID (and one per
   extension, if any).
3. App Store Connect → Apps → + New App: platform iOS, name, primary language,
   that bundle ID, a SKU.
4. Xcode → Report navigator → Cloud → Create Workflow for the app (or App Store
   Connect → the app → Xcode Cloud): grant access to the GitHub repository.
5. One workflow, per Apple's "Creating a workflow that builds your app for
   distribution"
   (<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-a-workflow-that-builds-your-app-for-distribution>):
   - General: restrict editing — required for a build eligible for App Review;
   - Environment: Clean;
   - start condition: branch changes on `testflight` only (remove the default on
     `main`);
   - action: Archive — iOS, distribution **TestFlight and App Store**, not
     "Internal Testing Only": in this model the build submitted to App Review is
     a TestFlight round's build;
   - no test action: GitHub Actions ran the tests for that exact commit;
   - post-action: TestFlight internal testing with a group that includes you.
6. First build: after the repository side is in place, `just tf-check` and a
   `tf-` tag. The Xcode Cloud run appears under the workflow; the build reaches
   TestFlight after processing.

## Adopting it in an app

1. `just harness-update`.
2. Copy both workflow templates to `.github/workflows/` unchanged; delete any
   other workflow that runs tests or moves `testflight` or `release`.
3. Copy `Tooling/templates/ci_post_clone.sh` to `ci_scripts/` next to the
   `.xcodeproj` (merge an existing one; keep only app-specific extras). Replace,
   do not keep, a script that searches with `find .`: Xcode Cloud runs custom
   scripts from the `ci_scripts` directory (Apple, "Writing custom build
   scripts"), so `find .` sees no `project.pbxproj` and the build-number
   rewrite silently does nothing. The template searches
   `$CI_PRIMARY_REPOSITORY_PATH`. Found in OneCart on 2026-09-21: its old
   script printed "Successfully updated" while leaving the number at 1;
   reproduced from a `ci_scripts` working directory with `CI_BUILD_NUMBER=106`.
4. Move app-specific CI steps into the app's `ci` recipe; delete app copies of
   Runtime scripts (`build-slot.sh`, TestFlight promotion, tf-check).
5. Set the repository variables; for a private repository, the self-hosted runner.
6. Verify: a push to `main` gives a green `Tests` run and moves nothing; then
   `just tf-check` and a `tf-` tag give one Xcode Cloud build.

Contracts: `tests/ci-contract.sh`, `tests/build-slot-contract.sh`,
`tests/testflight-contract.sh`.
